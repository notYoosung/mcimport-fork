# mcimport
Convert Minecraft maps to Minetest worlds

The process is offline. Minecraft should not be running on the world
that is to be converted. The output should be an empty folder, and
no map.sqlite should be present in the empty folder.

The output is a world folder that is playable, permitted that the
required minetest mods are installed. If mods are missing, you will
encounter "Unknown" blocks in the minetest world.

This mcimport fork was created to improve on the existing mcimport
project, with one significant change: This form aims to create
*playable* minetest worlds where stuff works:

- chests can be used to put stuff in
- doors open and close
- simple mesecons circuits may work
- furnaces work

Also, the assumption is that converted maps are for multiplayer
use, and that the most important motivation for using this
converter is to *preserve* previously custom built objects
and buildings, but *not* meant to preserve the gameplay style
and feel of minecraft. As such, there are numerous blocks that
are *not* converted 1:1 from MC to MT. A good example is Lapis
Lazuli. LL ore will be converted to plain stone, and LL blocks
into blue wool, simply because there is no reasonable equivalent
in MT that is an actually useful block and not something created
purely to copy MC. This project also aims to never convert
blocks to "Unknown" nodes and strives to leave a playable are
that is friendly for users performing a one-time conversion.

- some flowers are approximations
- double plants may end up being single node blocks
- wood types are similarly not an exact copy
- until fixed, beds, doors, fences, walls are likely broken
- signs convert, but MT can't rotate them in 30 degree angles

There are a large number of things that are just never going to
be convertable, and so the following will likely never work and
are therefore converted to air blocks. Entities are readily
spawned by several mob mods in minetest, so conversion is likely
not critical to users, and left out.

- crafting table
- hoppers, dispensers, droppers
- entities

# Usage:

You'll need to use a Linux system and have python installed. The
easiest way to invoke the converter is to run the `mcimport.sh`
script without any parameters. This takes you through a bunch of
screens that you can use to select a world and configure a few
settings.
#
# win10
* [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) Installation, Add Python to PATH
* Copy the map to the `mcimport-master` folder
* `Command Prompt`to`mcimport-master` location, Key in  ```python mcimport.py Enter out```  `Enter` Replace with your map nameï¼Œ`out` is your name after Convert.
* you need Download [Map](https://github.com/Pantyhose-X/AISS_mcimport/releases) Or go to the map after you Convert . Open the `get-mods.sh`  with Notepad to download the mods link. `Copy mod to minetest\mods,Copy map to minetest\worlds`
* Currently; you need to find the minecraft coordinates, and convert them before teleporting to the minetest ones.
```
Coordinate Conversion from Minecraft to Minetest:

X = Approximately +16 nodes
Y = Approximately -64 nodes
Z = The number is approximately inverted. -16 nodes
```
A general [Example](https://github.com/minetest-tools/mcimport/issues/34) of converted coordinates:
````
 Minecraft: 100, 1, -100 
 Minetest: 116, -63, 84
 ````
#
I took a quick look at that map's coordinates in minecraft. You'll need to teleport/fly to the following coordinates in your converted world.
`````
/grantme all
/teleport 116,-63,-100
`````
